# Clack: Clarkson Univerity Slack
This is a multi-user chat channel developed for CS242: Advanced Programming Concepts in Java at Clarkson University in Fall 2022. The entire system 
is implemented in Java using IntelliJ as the development enviorment. The app has a server that handles all of the incoming connections from many clients, 
each client can connect to the server and then talk to all other clients through the server. There is the ability to send a text message or text file.
There is also a functionality that allows for the client to ask for a list of all connected clients. The messages are sent after being encrypted using the 
Vigen√®re cipher then decrypted when the clients receive the message.
