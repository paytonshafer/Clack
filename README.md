In your test classes, what happens if you provide a negative value for a port number, or a null value for a user? How do you think you can fix these issues?
A negative value as the port number just makes it so the value of the port is negative. When there is a null value for the user it messes with the hashcode because there is no hashcode for a null value. We could put in a test to make sure the inputs are the correct form.
